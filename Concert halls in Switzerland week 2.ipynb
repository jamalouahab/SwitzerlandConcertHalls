Data on Cities \n\nData on cities will include:\n\n- Geospatial coordinates\n- The state in which the city is located\n- The population\n- The name of the city\n\nAll this data will be scrapped from the website (it also can be done from a downloadable csv file).\nhttps://simplemaps.com/data/ch-cities\n\n\n\n### II. Data on concert halls\n\nBased on foursquare, we will be able to retrieve the venues, located in the different cities.\nHere is an example of concert hall as described in foursquare.\nhttps://foursquare.com/v/lusine/4adcdab5f964a5209a5021e3\nA concert hall, is considered a 'Category' and this data should be easy to extract using the API.\n\nWe will be only focusing on the number of venues, we will need to defines the radius used to include a venue in the city or not.\n"
